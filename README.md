 Goal: Built a machine learning model to predict car prices using the Cars93 dataset.
 Conducted Data cleaning, feature separation, encoding, and scaling using scikit-learn pipeline.
 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applied Linear Regression for price prediction.
 Explored Feature relationships, price trends, and evaluated model using RÂ², MAE, and MSE to draw meaningful insights.
